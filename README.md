I`m a new programmer, starting out in this long waited journey.

I`ve 29 year now, studied the law, graduated in law-school, did my best in what I could, but never was happy, satisfied.

After my father died I decided I need to do what I desire, what I really love, that`s why I decided to start programming, started small, with basic HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript, then spread out a little, learned basic ruby and rails, php (mainly wordpress), jquery, and some fullstack javascript.

And this is the short version, if you are interested in the long one... well, buy me a beer!

I`ll add a portuguese version one day... maybe...
